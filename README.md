# Deck Shuffling And Ordering (C# Console Application)
A program to determine how many rounds it will take to put a deck back into the original order.

## Problem Description

This module solves a coding problem that involves shuffling a deck of cards.  The problem description is as follows:
We are given a deck containing n cards.  While holding the deck:
* Take the top card off the deck and set it on the table.
* Take the next card off the top and put it on the bottom of the deck in your hand.
* Continue steps 1 and 2 until all cards are on the table.  This is a round.
* Pick up the deck from the table and repeat steps 1-3 until the deck is in the original order.
    
## Solution
Code can be directly accessed through this link below: https://github.com/nasreekar/DeckShufflingAndOrdering/blob/master/CardsOrdering/CardsOrdering/Program.cs

* The program is a console application that will require an input for the total number of cards in the deck.
* Assign card values (From 1 to less than equal to number of cards in deck)
* Use of Lists,queue's and arrays

## Bottom Line
I think this problem can be solved in many other ways for better optimization. But this is my take on it.
